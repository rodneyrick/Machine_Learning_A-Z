***YOUR SPECIAL BONUS***
Section 40, Lecture 277
Hey Data Scientist,

Congrats on completing all (or part) of the Machine Learning course!

(Note: if you don't like reading long texts, then skip to the bottom. Your bonus is there!)

Such a big course, right? What did you like most about it? I liked the SVM tutorials and the Kernel trick. That was really cool :)

So.... the obvious question is what's next?

We've got some good news for you!

Not so long ago Hadelin and I ran Kickstarter campaign to create what we believe is the World's most disruptive course on Deep Learning.

And that's how we created Deep Learning A-Z™ (https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/?couponCode=YESDATA)

In side this course you get 6 modules:

 - Artificial Neural Networks (like in the ML course + advanced tutorials)
 - Convolutional Neural Networks (like in the ML course + advanced tutorials)
 - Recurrent Neural Networks
 - Self-Organizing Maps
 - Boltzmann Machines
 - AutoEncoders

Just like in the Machine Learning course, each module comes with easy-to-digest intuition tutorials and very hands-on practical applications solving Real-World challenges. Note: this course is Python-only.

This is the fastest way to get up-to-speed with one of the most powerful technologies in the World Right now!

So what are you waiting for? 

Join us inside Deep Learning A-Z™ and discover the World of Artificial Intelligence!
